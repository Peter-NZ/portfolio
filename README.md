This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Portfolio/Website

This repo contains the code for my personal portfolio/website which is currently deployed [here](https://www.peterdavidson.dev/). I built it using ReactJS, making use of SCSS modules for component scoped styles. Feel free to take a look around.

## Local Set-up and Installation

### `npm install`
This will install the dependencies the app needs to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
The tests mostly just cover basic prop rendering.
